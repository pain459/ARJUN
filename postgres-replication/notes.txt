Start the servers
docker-compose up -d

This command will:

Start the postgres-master container.
The setup-replication.sh script in the master will create a replication user and configure PostgreSQL.
Start the postgres-replica container.
The setup-replication.sh script in the replica will wait for the master to be ready, then initiate the replication process.
Step 5: Verify Replication
You can verify that replication is working by connecting to both the master and the replica and checking the replication status.

Check replication status on the master:
docker exec -it postgres-master psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"

Check the replica:
On the replica, you should see the data replicating from the master. You can check the replicaâ€™s status:

docker exec -it postgres-replica psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_wal_receiver;"

Step 6: Scaling Replicas
You can scale the number of replicas by adding more services to the docker-compose.yml file or by using Docker Compose scaling features:

docker-compose up --scale postgres-replica=3 -d
This command would create three replicas.
