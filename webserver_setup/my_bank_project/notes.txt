### Sample curl calls.

1. Create a Bank
To create a new bank, use the POST method. You need to provide the name and country as form data.

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/banks/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "name=Bank of America&country=US"

2. Read a Bank
To retrieve the details of a specific bank, use the GET method and pass the bank_id as a path parameter.

curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/banks/USBOA202308144a3f2d" \
     -H "accept: application/json"
Note: Replace USBOA202308144a3f2d with the actual bank_id you got from the create operation.

     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
